The first requirement for international travel is passport and visa. Since the passport is there, now let's talk about the visa, especially the Thailand visa is complicated for many and easy for many. Because many people have BL/VL/B type seals for this visa, so there is a concern. And once the visa is done, no one seems to have this problem later. Now let's talk about my visa",

        "description":"You will need 3 days to see Tashkent city. For example, if you go to Charsu Bazaar in the morning and visit Uzbekistan Tower (TV Tower) in the afternoon, you will need a lot of food at that time. There are several of the world's largest Polao Dis restaurants (#beshqozon). Starting from Tk 320 (Uzbek Sum 32000/-) and special plate at Tk 360 (Uzbek Sum 36000/-). And in the evening go to Magic City. In this way you can visit 3/4 places in a day and eat. Plan again the next day. Always go to Charsu Bazar in the morning or it all closes in the afternoon. These places are really good. This place is like our new market area. Some places require money to enter. Like Magic City and some sightseeing places. But there is nothing inside. You will get the whole Uzbekistan Europe Phil. To me, traveling to Dubai and Qatar felt that everything was artificial, but the tourist sports of Uzbekistan are the history of the thousand years. I cannot satisfy myself and you by writing this history. It is hoped that you will be able to satisfy your heart's desire by seeing it with your own eyes.",
